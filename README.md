# TheLostHistory
Take a sip and deep dive into the monuments and culture that have been lost.

## 💡 Inspiration
We all know many cultural and historical sites have been destroyed, flooded, bombed, and whatnot. We never got a good glimpse of them since we could not go in the past. Thanks to technologies out there we are able to tackle this as well and take a deep dive into all the monuments and cultures that have been lost. Here comes our web application **"TheLostHistory"**. On our website, you can take a sneak peek at different ancient heritage from Chinese cities-Xi'an, Meca Verde,  Valley Of The Kings to Mar Saba, Castle Of La Muela, and Histria Fortress.
On **"TheLostHistory"**, learn about the history of the world and how it has changed over time. To get a better view we have even made 3D models of various ancient monuments on the map.

## 💻 What it does

Our web app TheLostHistory is built with features:

- Learn more about various ancient civilizations and their contributions to the world.
- Learn about the history of the world and how it has changed over time.
- View the 3D model of various ancient monuments on the map.
- Learn the loaction of various ancient monuments on the map.

## ⚙️ How we built it

- Frontend: HTML, CSS and Js
- Backend: Django
- User Auth: Auth0
- Three Js: Rendering 3D models

## 🔐 Best Use of Auth0

Because we wanted to create an extremely secure application, we used the Auth0 authentication system for user sign-in. With thorough statistics, a wide range of possible providers, and a selection of user-friendly features the developer will truly like, Auth0 offers the most comprehensive capabilities to assure user authentication and authorization. When developing the app, we used social services like Google, which is enabled by Auth0, to log in.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- It was my first time building a backend with Django, and learning how to use it with Fronend.
- It was a bit difficult to implement the Three Js and add 3D models on the map.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
- We are proud of the fact that we were able to implement the 3D Model on Map feature in the project.

## 📖 What we learned
