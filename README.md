## 💡 Inspiration

We all know many cultural and historical sites have been destroyed, flooded, bombed, and whatnot. We never got a good glimpse of them since we could not go in the past. Thanks to technologies out there we are able to tackle this as well and take a deep dive into all the monuments and cultures that have been lost. Here comes our web application **"TheLostHistory"**. On our website, you can take a sneak peek at different ancient heritage from Chinese cities-Xi'an, Meca Verde,  Valley Of The Kings to Mar Saba, Castle Of La Muela, and Histria Fortress.
On **"TheLostHistory"**, learn about the history of the world and how it has changed over time. To get a better view we have even made 3D models of various ancient monuments on the map.
