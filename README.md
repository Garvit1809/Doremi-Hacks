A platform where singers and musicians can post their work. Producers and labels can check out the work and also contact the artist they think is talented.

## Introduction

The current population of millions, if not billions, makes it difficult to locate outstanding vocalists. Such musicians and vocalists can upload their work on the **Sangeet Artist** portal in an effort to get found by music producers and companies. They will be able to display their talents and draw in music fans. Additionally, companies and producers seeking up-and-coming talent may always visit this page to get in touch with musicians to join their team or label.

This website attempts to improve connection between artists, producers, and record labels.

## 💡 Inspiration

Nowadays, due to the lack of online channels for artists, singers and musicians, they are not able to contact labels and music producers. Additionally, these musicians are not compensated appropriately with their ability and effort, and often, labels retain the majority of their earnings, forcing them to continue working for the same label due to a lack of recognition and exposure.

This is the reasoning behind our proposal to set up a website where singers and musicians may upload their work. Producers and labels may go through the work and get in touch with the outstanding artist they believe.

On the **Sangeet Artist** site, musicians and singers may post their work in an effort to get discovered by record labels and music producers. They will be able to showcase their skills and entice music lovers. This will not only provide them recognition for their own efforts but also increase their visibility for producers and other band leaders. Additionally, businesses and producers looking for emerging talent may contact musicians on this website to join their team or label.

The goal of this website is to strengthen relationships between record companies, producers, and artists.

## 😵😵 Challenges we ran into

- We decided to make a UI Design before actually coding frontend which increased our workload.
- Completing the project was a challenge because we had to implement the project by a deadline.
- We had a tough time getting the audio from users and playing it on the website as we were doing it for the first time.
- Being able to mint the cover art of the song as a NFT was a prominent feature and we even made UI Designs for it, but then due to some errors in the DeSo website itself, we were unable to use DeSo and we had to cancel the feature which not only wasted our time but also increased our workload.

## 🏅🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of

- We are proud of the fact that we were able to complete the project in the given time.
- We are proud because even after facing errors and challenges we did not give up and we were able to complete the project.

## 📖 What we learned
